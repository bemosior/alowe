### What I do:

I specialize in the experience, behavior, and health of human beings. I have a PhD in clinical psychology, but I don't work as a traditional professional psychologist. It's more accurate to call me an applied [phenomenologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)). Or a psychological [inventor](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inventor). Or even, maybe a technological [pharmacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmakon_(philosophy)).  

I'm broadly interested in issues related to creating [humane technologies](http://humanetech.com/). I'm particularly interested in the world of cryptocurrency, which I've been following since 2013.  

As the co-founder of [Flywheel Design Firm](https://flywheeldesignfirm.com/), I'm doing R&D on the problem of creating decentralized and/or distributed organizational structures.  We're currently looking for organizational customers to collaborate with us on developing our solutions, mostly likely by using [participatory action research](https://participaction.wordpress.com/whatpar/defining-par/), an applied research method that simultaneously generates data and creates positive transformations in organizations.



### Where you can find me:

I blog [here](https://medium.com/being-human-is-a-feature-not-a-bug). 

I like to take pictures. I aim to post a picture a day [here](https://www.instagram.com/_sun_lite/) (though I'm not too strict and sometimes get derailed).  

I check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loweamanda) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004169838616) regularly, and even sometimes get into deep conversations there.

I follow people and occasionally lurk on [twitter](https://twitter.com/CELaboratories). Every so often, I try to figure out how to relate to people there. So far it hasn't worked, but I haven't given up hope yet that I'll have some kind of insight and change.

And there's always the good, old fashioned, [original killer app](mailto:amandalowephd@gmail.com). I check my email pretty often, usually daily. But sometimes I don't for days--sometimes longer--if I'm immersed in something that requires my full concentration.
