I blog [here](https://medium.com/being-human-is-a-feature-not-a-bug). 

I like to take pictures. I aim to post a picture a day [here](https://www.instagram.com/_sun_lite/) (though I'm not too strict and sometimes get derailed).  

I check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loweamanda) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004169838616) regularly, and even sometimes get into deep conversations there.

I follow people and occasionally lurk on [twitter](https://twitter.com/CELaboratories). Every so often, I try to figure out how to relate to people there. So far it hasn't worked, but I haven't given up hope yet that I'll have some kind of insight and change.

And there's always the good, old fashioned, [original killer app](mailto:amandalowephd@gmail.com). I check my email pretty often, usually daily. But sometimes I don't for days--sometimes longer--if I'm immersed in something that requires my full concentration.
