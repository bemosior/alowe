title: What I Do
---

I specialize in the experience, behavior, and health of human beings. I have a PhD in clinical psychology, but I don't work as a traditional professional psychologist. You might call me an applied [phenomenologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)). Or a psychological [inventor](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inventor). Or even, maybe a technological [pharmacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmakon_(philosophy)).  

I'm broadly interested in [humane technologies](http://humanetech.com/). I'm particularly interested in the promise and perils of cryptocurrency, which I've been following since 2012ish.  

As the co-founder of [Flywheel Design Firm](https://flywheeldesignfirm.com/), I'm doing R&D on the problem of creating decentralized/distributed technologies and organizational structures.

We're currently looking for organizational customers to collaborate with us on developing our solutions, mostly likely by using [participatory action research](https://participaction.wordpress.com/whatpar/defining-par/).
